                We use third-party services for identity verification and fraud
                prevention purposes. These biometric information services,
                acting as our processors, may collect a copy of your
                government-issued ID (i.e., your driver’s license, state ID
                card, or passport) and a scan of the picture on your
                government-issued ID for identification purposes (“biometric
                information”) and employ facial recognition technology to verify
                your identity. These biometric information services provide us
                with a confirmation as to whether your identity has been
                validated or not. Except as stated here, FundMySite does not
                retain any biometric information, and instead that information
                is maintained by the processors performing the services.

                The Platform is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting
                the Platform from outside the United States, please be aware
                that your information may be transferred to, stored and
                processed in the United States where our servers are located and
                our central database is operated. The data protection and other
                laws of the United States and other countries might not be as
                comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Platform,
                you consent to your information being transferred to our
                facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with
                whom we share it as described in this Policy.

                If you are located in Europe, you have the right to ask for an
                overview of the information we process about you, and for a copy
                of your information. In addition, you may request us to update
                and correct inaccuracies, delete your information, restrict
                processing of your information, or exercise your right to data
                portability to easily transfer your information to another
                company. In some cases, you may object to the processing of your
                information and where we have asked you for your consent to
                process your information, you can withdraw it at any time. You
                may also withdraw a previously given consent for processing your
                personal information; the withdrawal of consent shall not affect
                the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its
                withdrawal. The above rights may be limited under applicable
                law.
