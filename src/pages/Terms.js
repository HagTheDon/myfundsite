                individual, entity or non-profit organization (the
                &#8220;Organizer&#8221;) to post a fundraiser

                under the applicable laws of incorporation (“Charity”) . To the

                provincial, territorial, local or any other tax authority with
                respect to the characterization on any applicable tax return of
                any Donation by you, any User or any Charity. You should consult
                your tax advisor as to the amount of your Donation that is tax
                deductible or eligible for tax recognition, having regard to

              <span>
                FundMySite has partnered with PayPal and, in limited
                circumstances, Adyen or Stripe, for Donations to Charities.
                Although exceptions can be made, Charities in the United States,
                United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and Australia will be defaulted
                to using PayPal to process Donations made through the Services.
                The manner in which transactions are processed is explained
                below. Charities in other countries will be defaulted to using
                Adyen or Stripe.

            <p>
              <span>
                i. PayPal is the Payment Processor for Fundraisers with a
                Charity identified as a Beneficiary.{' '}
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                ii. In the United States, all Donations made through those
                Fundraisers will be accepted by PayPal Giving Fund, a
                grant-giving IRS-registered 501(c)(3) public charity. PayPal
                Giving Fund receives Donations from Users as the charity of
                record and then, to the extent it is able, grants Funds to the
                Charity selected by the Organizer and identified in the
                Fundraiser. While PayPal Giving Fund takes multiple steps to
                attempt to grant donated funds according to the Donor&#8217;s
                identified preference, PayPal Giving Fund retains exclusive
                control over all Donations. If a Charity fails to meet the terms
                of PayPal Giving Fund’s Nonprofit Certification Policy and/or
                fails to meet PayPal Giving Fund’s due diligence standards for
                receipt of a donation at any time, PayPal Giving Fund may
                reassign the funds in accordance with its policy{' '}

                . When PayPal Giving Fund receives your Donation, it will
                forward the Donation to the Charity of your choice, but PayPal
                Giving Fund will appear on your tax receipt. Donations made

                iii. PayPal Giving Fund has foreign counterparts, which are also
                registered charities in those countries. For example, if an
                Organizer in the United Kingdom starts a Fundraiser for a
                Charity in the United Kingdom, then PayPal will act as the
                Payment Processor with PayPal Giving Fund UK receiving the
                Donations. Thereafter, PayPal Giving Fund UK will grant funds to
                the Charity identified in the Fundraiser, to the extent it is
                able, and it will issue country dependent tax documentation for
                all Donations received through it.{' '}

                B. Adyen or Stripe. When Adyen or Stripe processes a Donation
                through the Services for a Charity, the Donation will go
                directly from the Donor to the Charity’s merchant account.
                Donations will appear on the Donor&#8217;s credit card statement
                under the name of the Charity to which the Donor contributed.

                handles, processes, or stores credit card information. The
                primary purpose of the standard is to maintain controls around

                A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a
                written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified
                U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if
                that other party has not provided a current physical address,
                then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Our current
                address for Notice is: FundMySite, Inc., ℅ Legal Department, 855
                Jefferson Avenue, PO Box 1329, Redwood City, CA 94063. The
                Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of
                the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief
                sought (“Demand”). We agree to work with you and make a good
                faith effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we aren’t
                successful within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration is
                received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. All
                arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential
                unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the
                arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either
                of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
                arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the
                arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written
                settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute
                prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (i) the

                If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of
                Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing
                fee unless your claim is for more than $10,000 in which case the
                payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any
                arbitration hearing will take place at an agreed upon location
                in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or
                less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted:
                (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
                arbitrator; (b) through a telephone hearing; or (c) by an
                in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county
                of your billing address. If the arbitration finds that either
                the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand
                is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
                the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil procedure
                11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA
                Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies
                previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to
                pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
                arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned
                written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings
                and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are
                based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as
                to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time
                during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
                within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

                We each agree to keep the arbitration proceedings, all
                information exchanged between us, and any settlement offers
                confidential, unless otherwise required by law or requested by
                law enforcement or any court or governmental body. However, we
                may each disclose these matters, in confidence, to our
                respective accountants, auditors, and insurance providers.

                You agree that FundMySite, in its sole discretion, may suspend
                or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or your access
                to the Services and remove and discard any User Content or data
                at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and
                without any liability to you or to any third party for any
                claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom.

                You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions
                with any other User in connection with the Services and
                FundMySite will have no liability or responsibility with respect
                thereto. FundMySite reserves the right, but has no obligation,
                to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any
                other User of the Services.

              <span>
                These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between
                you and FundMySite and govern your use of the Services,
                superseding any prior agreements between you and FundMySite with
                respect to the Services. You also may be subject to additional
                terms of service that may apply when you use affiliate or
                third-party services, third-party content or third-party
                software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of
                the State of California without regard to its conflict of law
                provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject
                to arbitration, as set forth above, you and FundMySite agree to
                submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
                and federal courts located within San Mateo County, California.
                The failure of FundMySite to exercise or enforce any right or
                provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver
                of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of
                Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or
                are otherwise) invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
                court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions
                as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these
                Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that
                regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
                cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services
                or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year
                after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
                A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
                electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
                proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same
                extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
                documents and records originally generated and maintained in
                printed form. You may not assign these Terms of Service without
                the prior written consent of FundMySite, but FundMySite may
                assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part,
                without restriction. If we fail to enforce any of our rights,
                that does not result in a waiver of that right. The section
                titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and
                have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made
                via either email or regular mail. The Services may also provide
                notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other
                matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on
                the Platform. FundMySite may, at any time, assign our rights or
                delegate our obligations hereunder without notice to you in
                connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of
                equity or assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. Nothing
                in these Terms shall prevent FundMySite from complying with the
                law. FundMySite shall not be liable for any delay or failure to
                perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control,
                including, but not limited to, acts of God, war or threats of
                war, terrorism or threats of terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of
                civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents,
                governmental regulation or advisory, recognized health
                threats,as determined by the World Health Organization, the
                Centers for Disease Control, or local government authority or
                health agencies, strikes or shortages or curtailment of
                transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
